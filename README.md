- Ready to upgrade with AI tools (chatbots, reminders, etc.)

## 🛠️ Services I Offer

- Local SEO setup (Google Maps, business listings)
- AI chat assistants for appointment booking or FAQs
- Tool consolidation for offices juggling multiple apps
- Consultation on simple digital systems for small clinics
